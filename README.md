PHP JOSE Application
==================

# Documentation

The official documentation is available as https://web-token.spomky-labs.com/

# Installation

```sh
curl -OL https://github.com/web-token/jwt-app/raw/gh-pages/jose.phar
curl -OL https://github.com/web-token/jwt-app/raw/gh-pages/jose.phar.pubkey
```

If everything is fine, you should have two files:

* jose.phar
* jose.phar.pubkey

You can move these files wherever you want (e.g. /usr/local/bin).
